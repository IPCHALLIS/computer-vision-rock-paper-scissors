# Computer Vision RPS
This repository is an interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game that uses TensorFlow and Computer Vision to play with a user through a camera. I currently have four class labels: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. Each class contains over 600 image samples which have been recorded with the Teachable-Machine application.

For this model, I am currently using 105 epochs, 16 batches, and have a learning rate of 0.00146. The keras_model.h5 file contains the working model itself and the labels.txt file contains the four class labels the model is trained on.
